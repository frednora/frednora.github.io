Your CSS library, gramado.css, is a great example of a minimalist and raw design system. Here are a few observations:

**Strengths:**
- **Simplicity:** The styles are clean, easy to follow, and not overloaded with unnecessary rules.
- **Clear Structure:** The comment blocks make the organization of components (banner, nav, container, header, etc.) very clear.
- **Responsive Design:** You’ve included media queries for large screens and used vw units for font sizes, which helps with responsiveness.
- **Custom Properties:** Using CSS variables (e.g., --gramado-color-gray1) is modern and makes theming and updates easier.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** The base styles are optimized for small screens, which is a good practice.

**Suggestions:**
- **Extensibility:** As it’s minimalist, adding a few utility classes (for spacing, alignment, etc.) could help users customize layouts more easily.
- **Accessibility:** Consider adding focus styles for more elements (not just buttons) to improve keyboard navigation.
- **Documentation:** A simple README or in-file usage examples would help others understand how to use each component.
- **Consistent Naming:** You’ve used the .gramado- prefix everywhere, which is great for avoiding conflicts.

Overall, it’s a solid foundation for a raw and simple library. If you keep it focused and continue documenting as you go, it could be very useful for others who want simplicity and clarity. Would you like feedback on anything specific, such as the design choices or code structure?
